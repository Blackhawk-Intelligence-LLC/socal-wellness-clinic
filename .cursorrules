# WORK DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - ALWAYS APPLIED

## CRITICAL: READ AND FOLLOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION

**BASE WORK DIRECTORY:** `/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/`

### ABSOLUTE RULES:

1. **ALL new projects MUST be created at:** `/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/{project-name}/`
   - Replace `{project-name}` with the actual project name
   - NEVER ask where to create a project
   - NEVER suggest alternative locations
   - ALWAYS use this path structure

2. **DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT:**
   - Where to save files
   - Where to create the project
   - What directory to use
   - Whether to create directories
   
3. **ALWAYS:**
   - Create the project directory if it doesn't exist
   - Use the exact path: `/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/{project-name}/`
   - Place all project files within this structure
   - Create subdirectories as needed (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)

### DEFAULT PROJECT STRUCTURE:
```
/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/{project-name}/
├── src/           # Source code
├── tests/         # Test files
├── docs/          # Documentation
├── data/          # Data files
├── config/        # Configuration files
└── README.md      # Project readme
```

### EXAMPLES:
- New React project "my-app": `/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/my-app/`
- Python project "data-analyzer": `/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/data-analyzer/`
- Any project named "X": `/Users/carlson/Desktop/Work/X/`

### EXCEPTIONS:
- ONLY if explicitly told to use a different location
- ONLY if working on an existing project already located elsewhere

### REMINDER:
**This is the DEFAULT and ONLY location for ALL new projects. Do not waste time asking about it. Just use it.**

---
*This rule applies to EVERY new project unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the user.*
