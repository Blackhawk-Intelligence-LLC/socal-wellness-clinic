# Booking API Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

I've successfully integrated a booking system into your doctorsweightclinics.com project. Here's what I've implemented:

## âœ… What's Been Added:

### 1. **Booking API Service** (`src/services/bookingApi.js`)
- Complete Acuity Scheduling API integration
- Support for all your services with proper durations
- Mock API for development/testing
- Functions for:
  - Creating appointments
  - Getting available times
  - Canceling appointments
  - Rescheduling appointments

### 2. **Enhanced Contact Component**
- Full booking form with date/time selection
- Service selection dropdown
- Real-time availability checking
- Success/error feedback with confirmation codes
- Form validation and error handling

### 3. **Booking Calendar Component** (Bonus!)
- Visual calendar for date selection
- Available time slots display
- Disabled weekends and past dates
- 3-month booking window

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- `.env.example` template for API credentials
- Secure credential management
- Mock mode for testing

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Go Live:

### 1. **Get Acuity Scheduling Account**
```bash
1. Sign up at: https://acuityscheduling.com/
2. Choose "Powerhouse" plan or higher (for API access)
3. Enable HIPAA compliance in settings
```

### 2. **Configure API Credentials**
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your credentials to .env
VITE_ACUITY_USER_ID=your_actual_user_id
VITE_ACUITY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=false
```

### 3. **Set Up Appointment Types in Acuity**
In your Acuity dashboard, create these appointment types:
- Medical Weight Loss (60 min)
- IV Therapy (45 min)
- Anti-Aging (60 min)
- PRP Hair Restoration (90 min)
- Hormone Replacement (60 min)
- Cellulite Z Wave (45 min)
- Erectile Dysfunction (60 min)
- NAD+ Therapy (120 min)

### 4. **Test Locally**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Test the booking flow with mock data first (VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true)

### 5. **Deploy to Production**

For **Vercel** deployment:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy (add env vars when prompted)
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Project Settings > Environment Variables
```

For **Netlify**:
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy the 'dist' folder
# Add env vars in Netlify dashboard
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations:

1. **Backend Proxy** (Recommended for production)
   - Don't expose API keys in frontend
   - Create a backend endpoint to proxy Acuity calls
   - Consider using Vercel Functions or Netlify Functions

2. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - Ensure Acuity HIPAA mode is enabled
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Don't store patient data in browser localStorage

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on your backend
   - Prevent appointment spam/abuse

## ðŸ“± Optional Enhancements:

1. **SMS Reminders**
   - Acuity includes automated SMS reminders
   - Configure in Acuity dashboard

2. **Email Confirmations**
   - Automatic email confirmations included
   - Customize templates in Acuity

3. **Google Calendar Sync**
   - Sync appointments to Google Calendar
   - Two-way sync available

4. **Payment Processing**
   - Accept deposits or full payment at booking
   - Integrate Stripe/Square through Acuity

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Test booking with mock API
- [ ] Test with real Acuity credentials
- [ ] Verify email confirmations work
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network issues, etc.)
- [ ] Verify HIPAA compliance settings

## ðŸŽ¯ Domain Setup:

- Update DNS A records to point to your host
- Set up SSL certificate (usually automatic with Vercel/Netlify)
- Configure www redirect if needed

Your booking system is ready to go! Just add the API credentials and deploy. The mock mode lets you test everything before going live. ðŸš€
